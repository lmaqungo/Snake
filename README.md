# Snake Game
Simple snake game clone
You can't die if your score iz zero. This is not a bug but instead a feature :/

**_Technologies_**: Python, pygame
**_Learnings_**: menus design 
**_Process and Inspiration_**: This project served as a taste of Python game development. This was my first completed programming project which I originally started in 2021. Just made some finishing touches to it, but the code is very messy. I just wanted to close the chapter as I'm not keen on refactoring this. Though I am keen on pursuing other pygame projects as I do like the workflow. I don't think I am confident yet to use a fully fledged commercial game engine such as the likes of Unity, and I much rather prefer implementing my own game functions. So I am comfortable with setting up camp here for a while.
